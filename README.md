MobileWebKitToolbox
===================

An iOS application to aide web developers in debugging their HTML5/Mobile Web applications.

Description
-----------

This is a universal application for iPhone/iPod Touch and iPad devices. It enables web developers to utilize WebKit's remote inspector capabilities to gain access to the full developer console from their desktop browser. Additionally, this app can enable the experimental WebGL support that is only currently available through the iAd framework.

Many thanks to Nathan de Vries and the invaluable information on his blog for demonstrating how to enable these amazing features through private API's: http://atnan.com/
